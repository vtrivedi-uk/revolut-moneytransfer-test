# revolut-moneytransfer-test
Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money transfers between accounts.

# Explicit requirements:
1. You can use Java or Kotlin.
2. Keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication).
3. Assume the API is invoked by multiple systems and services on behalf of end users.
4. You can use frameworks/libraries if you like ( except Spring ), but don't forget about
requirement #2 and keep it simple and avoid heavy frameworks.
5. The datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test.
6. The final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a
pre-installed container/server).
7. Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected.

# Implicit requirements:
1. The code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.
2. There are no detailed requirements, use common sense.

# Tech Stack

## Development:
  - Java-8
  - Gradle
  - SparkJava
  - Guice
  - Hibernate JPA
  - H2 DB

## Testing:
   - Junit
   - Mockito

## Design approach:
  - REST API to invoke service methods 
  - customized MVC style design
  - stateless
  - Concurrent request handling support for shared-state. (Thread Safe)
  - Atomic Transactions with 3-phase commit for fund transfers
 ### Dependency Injection Design:

- MoneyTransferApp business logic holder needs AccountService, MoneyTransferService for itâ€™s business.
- It does not create them but asks for them (the dependencies).
- The factory (using Guice) creates those dependencies and wire them to MoneyTransferApp. 
- The main method in the application launcher first instantiates the factory, the factory in turn instantiates the Controller and injects the dependencies. 
 Summary: Create the factory, create the application using the factory
 and then start the application!

		}
	]
```
## Get Account by ID

## Retrieve all money transfer transactions on specific account id
The folowing request retrieves all money transfer transactions on specific account id
```

## Usage
### Quick Start - Run
1. In Project Root Directory, type <br/>
```$xslt
 java -jar money-transfer-api-1.0.jar
```
This will start the application on http://localhost:8080 ,if the port is not used by another process.
or
```$xslt
1) ./gradlew build
2) ./gradlew start
```
This will start the application on http://localhost:8080 ,if the port is not used by another process.
### Run All Tests[Make sure nothing is running on port 8080]
```$xslt
./gradlew test
```
